GeodesicLibrary
===============

A C# PCL library to implement the JavaScript geodesic functions written by Chris Veness. The original JavaScript functions can be obtained from http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html. The main changes are that I am using UnitsNet (https://github.com/InitialForce/UnitsNet) to simplify unit conversions such as degrees to radians.
